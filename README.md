## RESTful_API

RESTful API documentation.

## Project Challenges
1. Time: Time is very short to build up a full stack web application by a group of new developers. 
2. Github: Its getting on our nerves to resolve conflicts with .pyc. But learned a lot of these. 
3. APIs: We searched for APIs to use, but didn't find any related things.
4. Migrations: Model designing should be carefully crafted before starting coding.
5. Heroku migrations: Another problem we found to migrate the modified model in the heroku. 

## Features
This app has some cool features! Such as:
1. There should three types of user, such as: Doctors, Patients and Admin
2. We used one to one relation and many to many relation.


## Futures
There are a lot of thing we can do if we have some time


## Setup
Describe how to install / setup your local environement / add link to demo version.

## Code Examples


## To-do list:
* to make presentable front-end design
* to choose Api for our project
* to make all skeleton components
* to make install Express, Node and Mongoose 
* to implement three types role based users authentication
