## RESTful_API

RESTful API documentation
No RESTful Api is used.

## Project Challenges

1. AJAX: I faced a some difficulties sending and retrieving data from the bac kend.
2. APIs: We searched for APIs to use, but didn't find any related things.
3. User: User authentication is a little bit complex process due to it is based on token.
4. Styling: I found difficulties in implementing css styles in the component level.

## Features
This app has some cool features! Such as:
1. There should three types of user, such as: Doctors, Patients and Admin
2. We used one to one relation and many to many relation.


## Futures
There are a lot of thing we can do if we have some time
1. I can consume third party API.
2. I can implement socket.io for chat purpose between and patient and doctor.
3. I can create a page for a doctor to see his patients for a particular day.
4. I can create a list of patients with frequency of appointments so that a doctor can check on that. 
5. I can add pictures of doctors to the list of doctors so that a patient can check and see his/her doctor.
